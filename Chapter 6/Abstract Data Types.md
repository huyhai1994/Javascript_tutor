- The main idea of object-oriented programming is to use object, or rather *types* of objects, as the unit of program organization. 
- The *abstract data type*, or *object class*, is a subprogram that may contain arbitrarily complicated code but exposes a limited set of methods and properties that people working with it are supposed to use.
	=> allow large programs to be built up out of a number of appliance types, limiting the degree to which these different parts are entangled by requiring them to only interact with each other in specific ways.
- If a problem is found in one such object class, it can often be repaired or even completely rewritten without impacting the rest of the program. Even better, it may be possible to use object classes in multiple different programs, avoiding the need of recreate their functionality from scratch. In JavaScript, arrays and strings are built-in data structures (reusable abstract data types).
- Each abstract data type has an *interface*, the collection of operations that external code can perform on it. Any details beyond that interface are *encapsulated*, treated as internal to the type an of no concern to the rest of the program.
