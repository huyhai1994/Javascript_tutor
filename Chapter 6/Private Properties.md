- It is common for classes to define some properties and methods for internal use that are not part of their interface. These are called `private` properties, as opposed to `public` ones, which are part of the object's external interface. 
- To declare a private method, put a # sign in front of its name. Such methods can be called only from inside the class declaration that defines them.
