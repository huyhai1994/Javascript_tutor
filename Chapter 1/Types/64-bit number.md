Right—JavaScript’s 64-bit “number” (an IEEE-754 double) still has finite limits:

1. **Maximum magnitude**

   * The largest finite value it can represent is about 1.797 693 134 862 3157×10³⁰⁸. Anything larger simply becomes `Infinity`.

2. **Integer precision**

   * Only integers up to 2⁵³–1 (≈9 007 199 254 740 991) are guaranteed exact. Beyond that, you lose integer precision—even if the magnitude is within 1e308, you’ll start “skipping” values.

3. **Why it matters**

   * If you need to work with integers larger than 2⁵³–1 or need exact arithmetic on very large whole numbers, the built-in `number` type isn’t sufficient.

4. **What to do instead**

   * **BigInt**: ECMAScript now has a native `BigInt` type for arbitrarily large integers:

     ```js
     const huge = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
     ```
   * **Big-number libraries**: For arbitrary-precision decimals (e.g. financial or scientific calculations), you can use libraries like \[decimal.js], \[big.js], or \[bignumber.js], which let you represent and operate on numbers of virtually any size without precision loss.

In short, 64 bits give you a huge—but not unlimited—range and precision. When you hit those limits, switch to `BigInt` or a specialized big-number library.
